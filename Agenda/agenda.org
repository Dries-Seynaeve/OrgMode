* Let this be a file full of tasks that I want to do:
* Active
** Eat
** TODO Sleep
* Backlog
* Agenda:
** Acces the Agende from org mode
Run
#+begin_src
M-x org-agenda
#+end_src
 and press
 #+begin_src
a
#+end_src
to find the agenda. For now this is empty, since we have not planned a date for the tasks.
** Schedule tasks and deadlines
In order to schedule a task:
#+begin_src 
M-x org-schedule (C-c C-s)
#+end_src
In order move through the agenda to schedule a task
#+begin_src
Shift + ArrowKeys
#+end_src
Similarly it is possible to schedule a deadline by running
#+begin_src
M-x org-deadline (C-c C-d)
#+end_src
In order to check the list directly, we can run:
#+begin_src
M-x org-agend-list
#+end_src
